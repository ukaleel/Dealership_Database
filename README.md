The goal of the project was to implement a database in Java using JDBC API. mimicking
 any industry domain. Selecting the car rental industry, our database simulates the records
 and tables needed to manage a car rental establishment. Though relatively simplified, the
 database reflects how a car would be entered, the details of the car, the rental information for
 the car, and the renterâ€™s details themselves.
